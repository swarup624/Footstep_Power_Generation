## 📌 Overview
The Footstep Power Generation System captures pressure generated by human walking and converts it into electrical energy using piezoelectric transducers. The generated energy is rectified, regulated, stored, and monitored in real time using a microcontroller and LCD display.

This project demonstrates sustainable energy generation for smart infrastructure applications such as railway stations, malls, and public walkways.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Footsteps apply mechanical stress on piezoelectric sensors  
2. Sensors generate AC voltage proportional to applied pressure  
3. AC output is converted to DC using a bridge rectifier  
4. Voltage is filtered and regulated  
5. Energy is stored and used to power loads  
6. Step count and voltage are displayed on the LCD
